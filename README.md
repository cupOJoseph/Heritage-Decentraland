# Heritage-Decentraland
A wrapper for the Heritage Smart Contract platform from [Airbus A^3](https://www.airbus-sv.com/) (HA3) for use in Decentraland (DCL)

# Goals
The goal of this project is to create a way for users to be able to interact with Heritage inside of Decentraland.

### WIP Features

- Display heritage donations as trophies inside of DCL

# Uses
There are several things you can do with this integration.
